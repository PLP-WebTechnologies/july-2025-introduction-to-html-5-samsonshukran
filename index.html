    <h3>Who is Samson</h3>
    <p>Am a Kenyan citizen by birth. Am from the coastal side of the KenyanRepublic in Kilifi County. Am a public
        Health student at Kenyatta University. I enjoy blending <B>Health</B> and <B>Technology</B> to create solutions
        that benefit communities. I combine <I>scientific knowledge</I> with <I>software tools</I> to build
        <EM>impactful community health initiatives.</EM>
    </P>

    <P>Am passionate about solving real-life problems using scientific methods and principles.
        I want to come up with tools that are most efficient and reliable in collection, analysis,presentation and
        storage of Health data. </p>

    <p>Am motivated by the desire to solve the challanges my community face in the field of health. I love finding
        creative , practical solutions to real-life issues. My biggest desire is to see the health sector get into full
        use of modern Tech to perform its functions. I would like to eradicate the use of bulky papers and books of hand
        written data so that one uses a mobile phone to access all resources requiered ranging from <b>data collecting
            tools, data storage tools, data analysis tools and presenting tools to disease surveillance, community alert
            response and mass Educational information</b>. These will all be available in portable mobile phone making
        service delivery more efficient and suffient</p>

    <h3>Programming Languages</h3>
    <p>These are some of languages that I have interacted with;</p>
    <ul>
        <li style="color: chocolate;">HTML</li>
        <P>HTML is used to create the structure of the web pages. It defines elements like headings, paragraphs, images,
            links and more. It acts likje a skeleton of website telling the browser what to display. It works with CSS
            and JavaScript to build full Website</P>

        <lI style="color: chocolate;">CSS</lI>
        <P>CSS is used to style and design HTML web pages. It controls the layout, colors, fonts, spacing, and
            animations on a website. While HTML structures the content, CSS makes it visually appealing. Styles can be
            written directly in the HTML file or separately in an external CSS file. CSS allows developers to create
            responsive and attractive web designs that work on all devices. It uses selectors to target HTML elements
            and apply styles. CSS is essential for web development and works with HTML and JavaScript to build complete
            and modern websites.</P>


        <li style="color: chocolate;">Python</li>

        <P>yhton is a powerful beginner friendly programming language known for its clear and simple syntax. It is used
            in web development, artificial inteligence and software development. It allws one to build websites, analyse
            data or create AI models</P>
        </P>
        <li style="color: chocolate;"> Java</li>
        <P>Java is a powerful, object-oriented programming language used for building desktop applications, mobile apps
            (especially Android), and large-scale backend systems. Unlike JavaScript, Java does not run in the browser
            but runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), making it platform-independent. Java is known for its stability,
            performance, and scalability. It is widely used in enterprise systems, banking applications, and Android
            development. Java uses a strong syntax and structure, requiring you to define variables, data types, and
            class structures. It's a good choice for serious software development and is taught in many computer science
            programs.</P>
        <li style="color: chocolate;">JavaScript</li>
        <P>JavaScript is a programming language used to make web pages interactive and dynamic. It runs in the browser
            and responds to user actions like clicks, input, or scrolling. With JavaScript, you can create slideshows,
            form validations, animations, games, and more. It can also communicate with servers to load data without
            refreshing the page (using AJAX). JavaScript is essential for frontend development and can also be used on
            the server side with Node.js. It's supported by all modern browsers and is a key technology in web
            development alongside HTML and CSS.</P>
    </ul>

    <h3>Educational Background</h3>
    Currently, am learning Software Engineering sponsered by Power Learn Project (PLP Academy).</p>
    <p>PLP Academy, also known as Power Learn Project. It is an amazing platform that teaches young Africans digital and
        tech skills, and it is helping people like me solve real-life problems through technology. What makes PLP
        Academy stand out is that it is not just focused on teaching theoryâ€”it is very practical. You learn
        things like web development, Python programming, mobile app creation, and even soft skills like communication
        and
        teamwork. But the best part is that everything is hands-on. You actually get to build real projects and solve
        problems that matter to your community.</p>
